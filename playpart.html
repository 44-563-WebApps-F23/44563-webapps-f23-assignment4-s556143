        Petra. Good evening.

        Dr. Stockmann. Good evening, Petra; come along.

        (Mutual greetings; PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a
        chair by the door.)

        Petra. And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while I
        have been out slaving!

        Dr. Stockmann. Well, come and enjoy yourself too!

        Billing. May I mix a glass for you?

        Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always
        mix it too strong. But I forgot, father—I have a letter for you. (Goes
        to the chair where she has laid her things.)

        Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom?

        Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I
        was going out.

        Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give to me
        now!

        Petra. I really had not time to run up again. There it is!

        Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let's see, let's see, child! (Looks
        at the address.) Yes, that's all right!

        Mrs. Stockmann. Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously,
        Thomas?

        Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and— Where shall I
        get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again?

        Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk.

        Dr. Stockmann. Good, good. Excuse me for a moment—, (Goes into his
        study.)

        Petra. What do you suppose it is, mother?

        Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; for the last day or two he has always
        been asking if the postman has not been.

        Billing. Probably some country patient.

        Petra. Poor old dad!—he will overwork himself soon. (Mixes a glass for
        herself.) There, that will taste good!

        Hovstad. Have you been teaching in the evening school again today?

        Petra (sipping from her glass). Two hours.

        Billing. And four hours of school in the morning?

        Petra. Five hours.

        Mrs. Stockmann. And you have still got exercises to correct, I see.
