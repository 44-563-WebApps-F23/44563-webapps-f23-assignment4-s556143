        <p>Good evening.</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
        <p>Good evening, Petra; come along.</p>
        <p>[Mutual greetings; PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a chair by the door.]</p>

        <h6>Petra.</h6> 
        <p>And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while have been out slaving!</p>

        <p>I mix a glass for you?</p>

        <h6>Petra</h6>
        <p>[coming to the table].</p> 
        <p>Thanks, I would rather do it; you always mix it too strong. But I forgot, father—I have a letter for you.</p> 
        <p>[Goes to the chair where she has laid her things.]</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>A letter? From whom?</p>

        <h6>Petra</h6> 
        <p>[looking in her coat pocket].</p> 
        <p>The postman gave it to me just as I was going out.</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann</h6> 
        <p>[getting up and going to her].</p>
        <p>And you only give to me now!</p>

        <h6>Petra.</h6> 
        <p>I really had not time to run up again.There it is!</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann</h6> 
        <p>[seizing the letter].</p> 
        <p>Let's see, let's see, child!</p> 
        <p>[Looks at the address.]</p> 
        <p>Yes, that's all right!</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously,Thomas?</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and— Where shall I get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again?</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk.</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>Good, good. Excuse me for a moment—,</p> 
        <p>[Goes into his study.]</p>

        <h6>Petra.</h6> 
        <p>What do you suppose it is, mother?</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> 
        <p>I don't know; for the last day or two he has always been asking if the postman has not been.</p>

        <h6>Billing.</h6> 
        <p>Probably some country patient.</p>

        <h6>Petra.</h6> 
        <p>Poor old dad!—he will overwork himself soon.</p> 
        <p>[Mixes a glass for herself.]</p> 
        <p>There, that will taste good!</p>

        <h6>Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p>Have you been teaching in the evening school again today?</p>

        <h6>Petra</h6> 
        <p>[sipping from her glass].</p> 
        <p>Two hours.</p>

        <h6>Billing.</h6> 
        <p>And four hours of school in the morning?</p>

        <h6>Petra.</h6> 
        <p>Five hours.</p>
